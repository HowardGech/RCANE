# RCANE
RCANE is a deep learning algorithm designed for predicting somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) across multiple cancer types using RNA-seq data. The dataset used for training and evaluating the method, along with a pre-trained model based on TCGA data, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fGjNujtDMMNToiijTjBjWFzphEZhtChE?usp=drive_link).
